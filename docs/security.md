# Security for users

Omnipus can run tools, shell commands, and programs on your machine. You control that access through permissions, the sandbox, encrypted credentials, and an audit log.

## What it is

Security in Omnipus uses several protections together. Tool policies decide whether an agent can call a tool. The sandbox limits what started programs can reach. The credential vault encrypts saved secrets. The audit log records security events, policy decisions, and tool executions.

Secret filtering adds another layer. It replaces registered credential values before selected content reaches a model. This filtering is best-effort and can be switched off. It does not make pasted or unregistered secrets safe.

## When you would use it

Review security settings before agents handle private files or untrusted content. Set stricter tool policies for actions that could change data, spend money, or contact another service.

Use the credential vault when you add an application programming interface key, connector token, or another secret. Review the audit log when you need to understand an allowed, denied, or failed action.

## How to control agent access

1. Open **Settings**, then select **Security**. You see the security health summary and the main protection settings.
2. Under **Agent tool access**, choose **Must ask first (safer)** or **Run freely**. This sets the default behavior.
3. Set **Shell command approval** to **Auto-allow**, **Ask each time**, or **Always deny**.
4. Open **Advanced / technical details** to set global rules for individual tools. Choose Allow, Ask, or Deny for each tool.
5. Open an agent's **Tools** tab when you need a rule for that agent. A global Deny cannot be loosened there.
6. Review each approval request before you respond. Choose **Approve**, **Always Allow**, or **Deny**. Always Allow remembers the exact arguments for that call.

These controls answer different questions.

| Control | What it decides | Use it when |
|---|---|---|
| Tool policy | Whether an agent may call a tool | You want Allow, Ask, or Deny for a specific capability |
| Shell command approval | How shell commands are handled | You want a separate default for commands |
| Process sandbox | What started programs may reach | You want operating-system isolation where the platform supports it |
| Filesystem model | What agents may read and run | You want open access or a confined list of locations |
| Shell workspace limit | Whether commands may name paths outside the working folder | You want a command-text check separate from the sandbox |

The process sandbox offers three modes. **Enforce** blocks violations. **Permissive** records violations without blocking them. **Off** removes operating-system protection, but it does not disable the shell workspace limit or blocked command patterns.

The **Confined** filesystem model limits reads and execution to listed locations. The **Open** model lets agents read and run anything your account can reach, apart from Omnipus secret files. Writes remain limited to the workspace and mounted folders. Changes to the filesystem model take effect after a gateway restart.

The Security screen reports the protection available on your current platform. If kernel-level protection is unavailable, Omnipus falls back to checks in the application. A program that ignores those checks is not contained by the operating system.

## How to manage saved secrets

1. Open **Settings**, then select **Security**.
2. Find **Credential Vault** and select **Add key**.
3. Enter a key name and its value, then select **Save**.
4. Re-type your password if Omnipus asks you to confirm the change.
5. To remove a saved secret, select its remove button and confirm **Remove**.
6. To replace the vault's master protection, select **Rotate master key**, enter a new passphrase, and select **Rotate**.

Omnipus stores credential values in an encrypted file. Settings refer to credentials by name instead of storing their plain values. On a fresh installation, Omnipus creates a master key and warns you to back it up. If you lose that key, existing credentials cannot be recovered.

Rotation re-encrypts the whole vault with the new passphrase. Back up the new passphrase because Omnipus needs it to unlock the vault later.

## How to review security activity

1. Open **Settings**, select **Security**, then open **Advanced / technical details**.
2. Find **Audit Log** and select **View Log**.
3. Filter entries by event or decision to narrow the list.
4. Check the chain status. **Chain verified** means the displayed log passed its integrity check.

The viewer refreshes every 30 seconds. The log includes security events, policy decisions, and tool executions. It can show security-setting changes with their previous and new values.

## Limits and things to watch

- Security controls reduce risk but do not make every agent action safe. Read approval details before allowing a request.
- **Permissive** sandbox mode observes violations but does not stop them. **Off** removes operating-system protection.
- Kernel-level protection varies by operating system and kernel capability. Trust the status shown on your Security screen for this installation.
- The Open filesystem model allows agents to read anything your account can read, except protected Omnipus secret files.
- Secret filtering is best-effort and can be switched off. It only knows registered credential values. Rotate a secret if you think it was exposed.
- Removing a credential is permanent. Services that refer to it may stop working.
- Losing the master key makes the encrypted credential store permanently inaccessible.
- **God-mode** under **Settings**, **Gateway** removes every permission prompt and disables the kernel sandbox, outbound-network restrictions, and shell guard for every agent. Audit logging, prompt protection, and rate limiting remain active. Enabling it requires your password and may require a gateway restart.
